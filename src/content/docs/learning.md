If you are going thru L100 or other internal trainings, you will be assigned labs by your mentor. Once the labs are assigned you should be able to see them here. If you dont see any labs, none is assigned to you.

After a lab is assigned you can

- [Deploy](builder#deploy)
- Troubleshoot and fix the problem.
- Use '_Validate_' button to check if the fix you applied is valid.
- After successful validatio, get in touch with your mentor.
- [Destroy](builder#destroy)

> If you are planning to work multiple labs at once you need to use different worksapces for each lab. Check Terraform > Workspaces.
