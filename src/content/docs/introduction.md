Deploying Azure Kubernetes Cluster is really easy. You can create production grade cluster with couple CLI commands. So what this project brings to the table you ask. There are hundereds of ways that an AKS cluster can be deployed in and then thousands more to configure and meet your unique requirements. If you have to deploy AKS with differnet configurations over and over again its no more an easy task. Along comes this project.
